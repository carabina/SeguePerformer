  s.description      = <<-DESC
A downside of UIViewController.performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:) is that
configuration of the presented view controller must occur separately in
UIViewController.prepare(for:sender:) instead of locally at the call site. This
can become particularly awkward in the context of multiple segues. SeguePerformer
improves upon this by providing
peformSegue(withIdentifier:sender:preparationHandler:), which provides an
opportunity to configure the presented view controller via a trailing closure.
